## ISPY: Automatic Issue-Solution Pair Extraction from Community Live Chats

In this paper they proposed an approach, named ISPY, to automatically extract issue-solution pairs from development community live chats. It use a basic CNN network with 15 heuristic attributes and Local-Attention mechanism to handle the characteristics of this task.

Image below is an example of ISPY:

## Predicting the objective and priority of issue reports in software repositories

In this paper they proposed a two-stage approach to predict both objective and importance of issue reports posted on software repositories. In the first stage, they fine-tune a Transformer-based objective classifier. In the second stage, they train the priority detection model.

Image below is a overall architecture of the proposed approach:

## FineLocator: A novel approach to method-level fine-grained bug localization by query expansion

In this paper they proposed an approach called FineLocator for method-level fine-grained bug localization by query expansion. They use word vector and TF-IDF to initialize the vector representation of bug reports and source code methods. Considering the sparseness in the representation of methods caused by its short lengths, they augment a method with its neighboring methods by query expansion. Specifically, semantic similarity, temporal proximity and call dependency are taken into account in measuring the neighboring relations between methods.
